# Project Pipe

Attempt at making a fluid flow simulator, currently mostly a 2d graphics engine with placeable nodes.

Some future goals are interpretening between simplified cfd and classical node simulation. But first I want a function simulation software with placeable nodes and connecting pipes. 

## Todo before demo release
* Simulation
* Material properties
* Ui with simulation information
* Saving and loading

## Incomplete!

Warning if you for some reasson stumble over this project and this warning is still here it means the project is severly unfinished and not at all ready, you can still look at it and download it but dont expect a working product of any kind. It is as of right now mostly just a tech demo/prototype.
